# automobile_UCI
The dataset is taken from the machine learning repository of UCI and consists of 205 instances and 26 attributes, consisting of categorical attributes such as make of car, engine-type, number of doors,etc , real and integer attributes such as price, horsepower, wheel-base, etc. My aim was to find the symboling of the car using machine learning algorithms. After, preprocessing the dataset for missing values, converting categorical attributes ,etc. I applied different algorithms like SVM with optimum parameters found via grid search, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest and xgboost, to find the various accuracies obtained from the different algorithms
